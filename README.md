The files were used for my final report for LING 583-01 Spring 2025. To run these files, download main4.py, config, and requirements. Update the config file with your own credentials, install requirements. Run main4.py to generate tweets.csv. 
Put tweets.csv in the same folder as the jupyter notebook. Update the notebook with your own openAI api key. Run the notebook to generate cluster_tweets, which contains the clusters, the associated tweets in each cluster, and the AI generated summary of the cluster.
